To be continue?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Today,I have been edit the settings.py,change the following keys in 
the DATABASES 'default' item to match our databases connection settings.

After this, I have been run the following command:
python manage.py syncdb
Some tables has been created in our databases automatically.
| auth_group                 |
| auth_group_permissions     |
| auth_message               |
| auth_permission            |
| auth_user                  |
| auth_user_groups           |
| auth_user_user_permissions |
| django_content_type        |
| django_session             |
| django_site                |
The default applications are included for the common case, but not everybody needs them. 
If you don't need any or all of them, feel free to comment-out or delete the appropriate 
line(s) from INSTALLED_APPS before running syncdb. 
The syncdb command will only create tables for apps in INSTALLED_APPS.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our environment -- a "project" -- is set up, we are set to start doing work.
I have created the app daileez.
Edit the settings.py file again, and change the INSTALLED_APPS setting to include the string 'daileez'.
Edit the daileez/models.py,and create class IconType,Icons.
Run the command 'Python manage.py sql daileez' to see CREATE TABLE SQL statements for the app.
Run the command 'Python manage.py syncdb' to update our database daileez.
